<p>
	Here's a tutorial on how to make and download a .zip file with PHP.
	<br>
	You basically have to: 
	<br> - use the "header()" function so that the page becomes a download
	<br> - use <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.ziparchive.php">ZipArchive</a> to create the desired .zip on the server
	<br> - write every byte of the newly created .zip on the page
	<br> - let the script end
</p>

<p>
	Once the .php is setup, you'll have to open the page with window.open() through JavaScript, and the .zip will be downloaded.
</p>

<p>
	The .php down here retries every second when it fails to create the .zip.
	<br>
	<span style="color: red">I don't know</span> if that's enough to guarantee the download of the newly created .zip, or if it's even necessary.
	<br>
	You could also just create the .zips with unique names, but for teaching purposes I feel like it's better to show how to use the open flags.
